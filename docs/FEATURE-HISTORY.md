# Broodforge Feature & Design-Intent History

**Trailing history of features and design intents** requested over time, newest cycle
last. Each entry records its **origin** (USER-REQUESTED vs. GAP-FILL — devised to fill
an under-specified idea), **status**, and **verification depth**:

- `static` — grep/pattern checks only
- `cli-probe` — `--help` / flag-existence checks
- `smoke` — ran the code path with synthetic/mocked inputs
- `unit` — covered by the pytest suite
- `deep-arch` — full execution pathway traced for gaps
- `user-tested` — confirmed by a real user on hardware (record version + feedback)

Timestamps are `YYYY-MM-DD_HH_MM_SS` UTC.

## Interactive HTML documentation toolkit (`proxmox-bootstrap/md_to_html.py`)

| Feature | Origin | Status | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Markdown → themed self-contained HTML | GAP-FILL (README/ROADMAP/etc. needed HTML twins) | Implemented | smoke (structure asserts on every generated doc) |
| Light/dark theme toggle (persisted) | USER-REQUESTED | Implemented | smoke (toggle + `body.light` present in output) |
| Per-code-block Copy buttons | USER-REQUESTED | Implemented | smoke |
| Live-templated commands (`{{VAR}}` → Parameters panel, live rewrite) | USER-REQUESTED | Implemented | smoke (param inputs + `.tpl` slots in drill HTML) |
| Note fields (`@field`/`@area`) + auto Session Notes | USER-REQUESTED | Implemented | smoke |
| File **Attachments** + **Export** to timestamped ZIP (`Title_YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS.zip`) | USER-REQUESTED | Implemented | smoke + **format-validated**: ported the JS CRC32/ZIP builder to Python and confirmed `zipfile` reads + CRC-checks the output |
| Theme toggle injected into hand-authored HTML (`inject_html_theme.py`) | GAP-FILL | Implemented | smoke (markers + balanced tags) |
| `--collapsible` (## sections → `<details>`) | GAP-FILL (FEATURE-HISTORY needs collapsible per memory) | Implemented | smoke |

> **Not yet user-tested.** The export/attachments + live-template UX has only been
> validated structurally and (for the ZIP) by format round-trip. A real browser test
> by the user would raise confidence to `user-tested`.

## Forge / spawn / phoenix workflow completeness (audit-driven)

| Feature | Origin | Status | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| Forge package self-bundles library code | GAP-FILL (docs implied it) | Implemented | smoke (tarball contents) + unit |
| Dashboard secret redaction on unauth GET | GAP-FILL (security) | Implemented | smoke (mask + non-mutation) + unit |
| `validate-spawn.py` conflict re-validator CLI + bundling | GAP-FILL | Implemented | smoke (collision→exit1, clean→exit0) |
| Phoenix playbook generation entry point (`phoenix-planner --state`) | GAP-FILL (missing step) | Implemented | smoke (generate→assemble→package) |
| `engine.py --set-timezone` (AD-045) | USER-REQUESTED (architecture decision) | Implemented | smoke |
| `spawn_hardware_discovery.py` CLI + sshpass password auth | GAP-FILL (documented step had no CLI) | Implemented | cli-probe + smoke (mocked runner) |
| `setup_ddns.py` CLI (both forge + manual forms) | GAP-FILL | Implemented | smoke (both forms, units written) |
| `init-bootstrap-state.py` manifest-seeded non-interactive init | GAP-FILL (would hang forge.sh) | Implemented | smoke (stdin-closed, seeded) |
| `setup_dnsmasq/headscale/tls.py` CLIs (forge phase-03) | GAP-FILL | See AUDIT-FINDINGS (in progress this cycle) | — |
| Forge OpenTofu VM modules + Ansible inventory generation | GAP-FILL | **Not implemented** — deploy-to-hardware milestone | deep-arch (gap confirmed); documented in FORGING.md |

## Documentation integrity

| Feature | Origin | Status | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| All documented `python3` commands resolve + flags implemented | USER-REQUESTED (no broken steps) | Implemented | deep-arch (import-aware flag cross-reference: 0 mismatches) |
| Durable `DESIGN-HISTORY.md` replacing versioned review churn | USER-REQUESTED | Implemented | static |
| `AUDIT-FINDINGS.md` (this trailing audit log) | USER-REQUESTED | Implemented | n/a |
| `FEATURE-HISTORY.md` (+ collapsible HTML) | USER-REQUESTED | Implemented | n/a |
