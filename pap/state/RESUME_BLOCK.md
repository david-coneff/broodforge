# Project Resume Block — broodforge

Instance of [PAP-State §3](../modules/PAP-State/PAP-State.md#3-project-resume-block)
(Project Resume Block), conforming to
[`resume-block.schema.yaml`](../modules/PAP-State/schemas/resume-block.schema.yaml).
This is **broodforge's own** resume block — a record of *broodforge's
codebase-development continuity*, governed going forward by PAP per
[`pap/revisions/2026-06-07_session-continuity-transition-to-pap.md`](../revisions/2026-06-07_session-continuity-transition-to-pap.md).
It is not, and does not describe, broodforge's *infrastructure remediation*
function (planner/queue/executor/policy) — that is the platform's product
behavior, not its development process, and is out of scope for this artifact
(see that transition record's "What this transition is — and is not" section).

---

- **project_identity**: Broodforge — a self-managing infrastructure platform
  for home-lab Proxmox + k3s environments (hardware assessment, cell forging,
  node spawning, phoenix recovery, continuous health monitoring, autonomous
  remediation). Six-layer lifecycle, seventeen-state model, three assessment
  tiers, five dependency-graph types. Architecture v7.1+. (Source:
  `.ai/context.md`, `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`.)

- **active_objective**: No implementation work is currently active. Per
  `.ai/NEXT_STEPS.md` and `.ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`, all roadmap milestones and
  all four planned intelligence tracks (through Phase 26 — Autonomous
  Operations) are complete, and the last `docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md` entry
  (now superseded — see the transition record) named the platform's own next
  action as **"deploy to hardware"** (`python3 proxmox-bootstrap/forge-planner.py`
  on a real Proxmox host; see `FORGING.md`).

- **active_milestone**: Post-Phase-26, pre-hardware-deployment. The
  intelligence/development side of the project is feature-complete per its
  own governance corpus; the next milestone named in that corpus is an
  *operational* one (a real hardware run), not a development one.

- **active_risks**:
  - The `pap`-driven audit recorded in
    [`pap/audits/2026-06-07_broodforge-pap-audit.md`](../audits/2026-06-07_broodforge-pap-audit.md)
    named three open, non-blocking findings broodforge's own governance has
    not yet acted on: F1 (Charter Purpose text has not kept pace with the
    built system), F2 (AD-034's automation boundary was crossed by Phase 26
    with no decision record marking the crossing), F3 (an untracked `new/`
    directory of ~25 proposed-revision documents sits outside governance,
    at risk of loss or silent scope drift — operator has since said this is
    "deferred for the moment," see that record's Provenance).
  - One deferred technical item from the prior (now-superseded)
    `docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`: "(A1) sys.path coupling in html workbooks +
    collect_tier2 that import from doc-gen/renderers via sys.path.insert —
    requires package restructure into a proper Python package. Low urgency —
    works correctly today."

- **blockers**: None known. (No BLOCKER-classified finding exists in the most
  recent PAP-AUDIT of broodforge; broodforge's own `docs/AUDIT-FINDINGS.md`
  cycles likewise show no open blocking item as of the last entry.)

- **next_action**: Concretely, for whoever next picks up broodforge's
  *codebase-development* thread (as distinct from its *operational*
  deployment thread, which `FORGING.md` already governs): triage the three
  open audit findings above (F1–F3) — each names a specific, low-cost,
  non-blocking governance-hygiene fix broodforge's maintainers can accept,
  adapt, or decline (see that audit record's "Summary of suggested work" for
  the concrete options) — and/or pick up the deferred `new/` analysis once the
  operator un-defers it. Either is a reasonable, evidence-grounded starting
  point; neither is mandatory before the other.

## Provenance

Created as part of
[`pap/revisions/2026-06-07_session-continuity-transition-to-pap.md`](../revisions/2026-06-07_session-continuity-transition-to-pap.md) —
the transition that moved broodforge's own session-continuity practice from
its pre-PAP prototype mechanisms (`.ai/AI_AGENT_BOOTSTRAP.md`,
`docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md`) onto PAP-State's formally-specified Resume Block
and Session Handoff Protocol. Update this block at minimum at every session
boundary and at every major milestone, per the schema's `update_trigger`.
